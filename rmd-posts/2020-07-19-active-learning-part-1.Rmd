I just started exploring the 'active learning' topic. It's a very handy tool when the number of data points to build a model is limited and labelling new points is costly. It allows to determine which points should be labelled next to bring the most gain in model performance. In this post I will cover some of my small experiments in this area.

Caution!

If you're interested in ready-to-use tools for active learning, this post might not be for you - I don't cover any framework here. It's all about fun (for me) and building some intuitions.

I will not describe ***active learning's*** basis ideas - if you're interested in this checkout Wikipedia page - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning). 

Let's start with loading packages required for my experiments.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(FSelectorRcpp)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```

To make some simulations, it's good to have some data. I grabbed a dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php. Below there's a code to download and unzip the data into `tmp` directory. 

```{r}
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16474696/read-system-tmp-dir-in-r
gettmpdir <- function() {
  tm <- Sys.getenv(c('TMPDIR', 'TMP', 'TEMP'))
  d <- which(file.info(tm)$isdir & file.access(tm, 2) == 0)
  if (length(d) > 0)
    tm[[d[1]]]
  else if (.Platform$OS.type == 'windows')
    Sys.getenv('R_USER')
  else
    '/tmp'
}

dataDir <- file.path(gettmpdir(), "data")
dir.create(dataDir, showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

dataZip <- file.path(dataDir, "bank-data.zip")
dataUrl <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank.zip"
download.file(dataUrl, dataZip)

unzip(dataZip, exdir = dataDir)

dataPath <- file.path(dataDir, "bank-full.csv")
message("Data path: ", dataPath)
```

Then the data needs to be prepared. Nothing special here, just simple reading data into R session and splitting it into train and test sets.

```{r}
# read data and split into test/traings sets
library(readr)
allData <- readr::read_delim(dataPath, delim = ";", 
  col_types = readr::cols(
  age = col_double(),
  job = col_character(),
  marital = col_character(),
  education = col_character(),
  default = col_character(),
  balance = col_double(),
  housing = col_character(),
  loan = col_character(),
  contact = col_character(),
  day = col_double(),
  month = col_character(),
  duration = col_double(),
  campaign = col_double(),
  pdays = col_double(),
  previous = col_double(),
  poutcome = col_character(),
  y = col_character()
  ))

allData <- allData %>%
  mutate(row_id = row_number()) %>%
  select(-month, -job) %>% # I have a problem with those two columns during 
                           # training phase so I removed them
  mutate(y = y == "yes") # transform to TRUE/FALSE

# split the data into train/test sets.
set.seed(123)
idx <- sample.int(nrow(allData), nrow(allData)*0.2)

trainAll <- allData[-idx,]
testAll <- allData[idx,]
```

For my 'AL' experiment I made a special workhorse function which handles nearly everything. As the last argument it takes a special function `get_new_idx` which returns the `rows_id` from `trainAll` data.frame to be added to `train` set in the next round. This simulates the active learning scheme. Data points selected by the `get_new_idx` would go to the oracle to be annotated.

As a model performance score I'm using AUC.

```{r}
#' @param get_new_idx function which returns the selected rows
#' indexes to be labelled by the oracle. In this function the 'active learning'
#' logic resides.
make_active_learning_path <- function(trainAll, testAll, nstart = 500, n = 50, k = 50, get_new_idx) {

  # init training data set by selecting randomly nstart rows from 
  # 'unlabelled' data
  idxInit <- tibble(row_id = sample(trainAll$row_id, nstart))
  train <- inner_join(trainAll, idxInit, by = "row_id")
  trainAll <- anti_join(trainAll, idxInit, by = "row_id")

  aucRes <- rep(0, n)

  for(i in 1:n) {

    # build a classification model using simple logistics regression
    fit <- glm(y ~ ., data = train %>% select(-row_id), family = "binomial")

    # calculate AUC
    res <- predict(fit, newdata = testAll, type="response")
    aucRes[i] <- suppressMessages(pROC::auc(testAll$y, res, ))

    # select new indexes which will be added to the training set
    newIdx <- get_new_idx(trainAll, train, fit, k)

    trainNew <- inner_join(trainAll, newIdx, by = "row_id")
    train    <- bind_rows(train, trainNew)
    
    # remove selected indexes from available 'unlabelled' set.
    trainAll <- anti_join(trainAll, newIdx,by = "row_id") 
  }
  
  return(aucRes)
}

```

## First experiment - the most uncertain points vs random sample. 

In the first attempt I'll use a function which selects data points for which the model is the most uncertain - in the binary classification task those will be the case where the estimated probability is closest to 0.5:

```{r}
get_new_idx_most_uncertain <- function(trainAll, train, fit, k) {
    predTrainLeftout <- predict(fit, newdata = trainAll, type="response")
    tr <- trainAll %>% mutate(predTrainLeftout = predTrainLeftout) %>% arrange(abs(predTrainLeftout - 0.5))
    tr %>% select(row_id) %>% head(k)
}
```

The second function selects the rows at random. There's nothing fancy in here:

```{r}
get_new_idx_random <- function(trainAll, train, fit, k) {
  trainAll %>% sample_n(k, replace = FALSE) %>% select(row_id)
}
```

Let's run the first two experiments:

```{r}
# utility function to transform pbreplicate result into data.frame
transform_run <- function(x) {
  xx <- t(x)
  colnames(xx) <- 1:ncol(xx)
  rownames(xx) <- 1:nrow(xx)
  res <- bind_cols(tibble(iter = 1:nrow(xx)), as.data.frame(xx))
  res <- pivot_longer(res, cols = c(-iter), names_to = "round", values_to = "AUC")
  res
}

## performing 20 replications of each simulations
set.seed(123)
mostUncertain <- pbapply::pbreplicate(
  20,
  make_active_learning_path(trainAll, testAll, get_new_idx = get_new_idx_most_uncertain)
  ) %>% transform_run %>% mutate(Type = "Most uncertain")

set.seed(123)
allRandom <- pbapply::pbreplicate(
  20,
  make_active_learning_path(trainAll, testAll, get_new_idx = get_new_idx_random)
  ) %>% transform_run %>% mutate(Type = "Random")
```
Some code to visualize the result:

```{r}
result <- bind_rows(mostUncertain, allRandom)

make_plot <- function(result, addRibbon = FALSE) {
  result2 <- result %>% 
    group_by(round, Type) %>%
    summarise(
      AUC_Mean = mean(AUC),
      SD = sd(AUC),
      q025 = quantile(AUC, probs = 0.025),
      q975 = quantile(AUC, probs = 0.975))
  
  p <- ggplot(result2 %>% mutate(round = as.integer(round))) +
    geom_line(aes(round, AUC_Mean, color = Type), size = 1.5) + 
    theme_bw()

  if(addRibbon) {
    p <- p +
      geom_ribbon(aes(round, ymax = q025, ymin = q975, fill = Type), alpha = 0.2)
  }

  return(p)
}

```

And there it is. Here I was really surprised, because I expected that selecting the points for which the model is the most uncertain would be much better than random sampling, but the opposite is true!

What could be the reason?

```{r}
make_plot(result = result)
```

I think for this data set the answer is imbalance in the training data. The most uncertain point is not the `50%` but `~11%`, because if we would not have any model (and we would just use the percentage of `yes` answers) we should assume that the probability of `yes` is around `11%`, not `50%`. 

```{r}
mean(allData$y)
```
So, let's adjust the rows selecting function to take care of the class imbalance (the only change is to replace `0.5` with `mean(train$y)`):

```{r}
get_new_idx_most_uncertain2 <- function(trainAll, train, fit, k) {
    predTrainLeftout <- predict(fit, newdata = trainAll, type="response")
    tr <- trainAll %>% mutate(predTrainLeftout = predTrainLeftout) %>% arrange(abs(predTrainLeftout - mean(train$y)))
    tr %>% select(row_id) %>% head(k)
}

set.seed(123)
mostUncertain2 <- pbapply::pbreplicate(
  20,
  make_active_learning_path(trainAll, testAll, get_new_idx = get_new_idx_most_uncertain2)
  ) %>% transform_run %>% mutate(Type = "Most uncertain - fixed")

```

As I was expecting, the result looks much better than the first version, but it's still worse than random selection. 

```{r}
result <- bind_rows(mostUncertain, mostUncertain2, allRandom)
make_plot(result)
```

It seems unintuitive, but it makes sense. To score which points should be taken into account I took only raw probability estimates, completely ignoring errors from the model. For one point the estimate might be `26% +- 5%` and for another `26% +- 20%`. In my case both points are treated equally, which seems wrong.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
fit <- glm(y ~ ., data = train %>% select(-row_id) %>% sample_n(500), family = "binomial")

pred <- predict(fit, se.fit = TRUE)
pred <- tibble(link = pred$fit, se.fit = pred$se.fit) %>% arrange(desc(link))

pred[51:54,] %>%
  mutate(Prob = plogis(link), Prob_1se = plogis(link + se.fit)) %>%
  mutate_all(function(x) round(x, digits = 3)) %>% 
  kable()

```

```{r}
get_new_idx_most_uncertain3_stdErr_based <- function(trainAll, train, fit, k) {
    stdErr <- predict(fit, newdata = trainAll, se.fit = TRUE)$se.fit
    tr <- trainAll %>% mutate(stdErr = stdErr) %>% arrange(desc(stdErr))
    tr %>% select(row_id) %>% head(k)
}

set.seed(123)
mostUncertain3StdErrBased <- pbapply::pbreplicate(
  20,
  make_active_learning_path(
    trainAll, testAll,
    get_new_idx = get_new_idx_most_uncertain3_stdErr_based)
  ) %>% transform_run %>% mutate(Type = "Most uncertain - std.err based")

```

The idea looked promising, but the reality is tough. This is the worst strategy from all four. Selecting by random is still the best. 

```{r}
make_plot(bind_rows(mostUncertain, mostUncertain2, allRandom, mostUncertain3StdErrBased))
```
