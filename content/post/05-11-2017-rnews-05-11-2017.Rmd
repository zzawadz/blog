Here is a small pack of some engaging news from R's world gathered from Twitter in the last week.

#### Articles

- https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/ - minimal amount of knowledge about Unicode. The article is targeted to developers, but it might also be useful for Data Scientists. I highly recommend other posts on that blog - the host is one of the creators of VBA in Excel, Trello, and StackOverflow.

- https://imgur.com/gallery/GD5gi - visualization of the sorting algorithms.

#### R Tips

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45101045/why-use-purrrmap-instead-of-lapply/47123420#47123420 - why is it better to use functions from the `purrr` package instead of `apply` family? (tl;dr - `purrr` interface is much more unified and predictable).

- http://psych-networks.com/r-tutorial-identify-communities-items-networks/ - how to use R's graphs packages to identify communities in your data.

- https://www.jessesadler.com/post/network-analysis-with-r/ - tutorial on network analysis in R. It's more basic article than previous one, but it might be useful for everyone interested in this topic.

- http://lenkiefer.com/2017/10/17/time-to-animate-with-tibbletime/ - another example of the `tibbletime` in action.
