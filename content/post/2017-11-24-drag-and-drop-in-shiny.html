<p>Shiny application is a great way to deliver the result of statistical analysis, especially when it must be reproducible. I don’t know why, but people prefer to use graphic interface, rather than run scripts;)</p>
<p>One of my clients recently requested to have an ability to move around elements in the dashboard. There are some R packages to attain such effect, and possibly it would be a bit easier to use them, but I had an unfinished project called <code>dragulaR</code>. It’s a very simple wrapper around javascript library <code>dragula</code> (<a href="https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/" class="uri">https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/</a>) which allows you to move around elements very, very easily. In the end, I decided to spend some time polishing <code>dragulaR</code>, and now it’s something quite usable, and I hope useful for others.</p>
