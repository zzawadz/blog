My primary language for data analysis is still R. However, when it comes to the Big Data I prefer Scala because of it is the central language behind Spark, and gives more freedom than the `sparklyr` interface (I sometimes use `sparklyr,` but this is a topic for another post).

When I started my journey with Scala I found, that it is possible to achieve a lot with knowing just the Spark's API and a bit of SQL. Nevertheless, I also realized that to take advantage of the full power of the native Spark API I need to learn more Scala's stuff. There are a lot of impressive parts of the Scala, but in this post, I discuss one thing - something called "Pimp My Library" pattern. I want something like this in R:)

To get some knowledge of a language, I think it's reasonable to find a library and read some code, to feel the syntax and see some constructs. My first choice was nscala-time (https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time), it's a library for dealing with time. In the main folder with a code I found something like this:

```scala
/**
 * The marker trait that this type is for 'pimp my library' pattern.
 */
trait PimpedType[T] extends Any{
  def underlying: T
}
```

I googled the phrase "pimp my library scala", and found this article - https://coderwall.com/p/k_1jzw/scala-s-pimp-my-library-pattern-example, and in this article in the comments a link for https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html.

So, what's going on? It turns out that Scala allows adding a new method to the existing class (there are some restrictions, for more information read official documentation - https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html).

So you can define a new method for `Int` class, like this (the example is taken from the nscala-time):

```scala
DateTime.now() + 2.months 
// returns org.joda.time.DateTime = 2009-06-27T13:25:59.195-07:00

2.hours + 45.minutes + 10.seconds
// returns com.github.nscala_time.time.DurationBuilder
// (can be used as a Duration or as a Period)
```

Methods `months`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds` can be used directly on the `Int` object. What it's even more interesting, this functionality is effortless. In my example, I'm using it to add three new functions to the `org.joda.time.LocalDate` class (it's used to represent a time in a YYYY-DD-MM format). The first function returns a sequence of all days from the current day of the month to the end. Second - from the beginning to the current date, and last function - from the beginning of the month to the end.

```scala

import com.github.nscala_time.time.Imports._

object nscalatest {

	implicit class SeqFncLocalDate(val date: LocalDate) extends AnyVal {
	    def toMonthEndSeq = (date.day.get to date.day.getMaximumValue).map(date.day(_))
	    def fromMonthStartSeq = (date.day.getMinimumValue to date.day.get).map(date.day(_))
	    def allDaysSeq = (date.day.getMinimumValue to date.day.getMaximumValue).map(date.day(_))
	}
  
  
  val start = LocalDate.parse("2018-01-15")
  //> start  : org.joda.time.LocalDate = 2018-01-15
  LocalDate.parse("2018-01-25").toMonthEndSeq     
  //> res0: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[org.joda.time.LocalDate] = Vecto
  //| r(2018-01-25, 2018-01-26, 2018-01-27, 2018-01-28, 2018-01-29, 2018-01-30, 20
  //| 18-01-31)
  LocalDate.parse("2018-01-05").fromMonthStartSeq 
  //> res1: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[org.joda.time.LocalDate] = Vecto
  //| r(2018-01-01, 2018-01-02, 2018-01-03, 2018-01-04, 2018-01-05)
  LocalDate.parse("2018-01-01").fromMonthStartSeq 
  //> res2: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[org.joda.time.LocalDate] = Vecto
  //| r(2018-01-01)
  LocalDate.parse("2018-01-15").allDaysSeq        
  //> res3: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[org.joda.time.LocalDate] = Vecto
  //| r(2018-01-01, 2018-01-02, 2018-01-03, 2018-01-04, 2018-01-05, 2018-01-06, 20
  //| 18-01-07, 2018-01-08, 2018-01-09, 2018-01-10, 2018-01-11, 2018-01-12, 2018-0
  //| 1-13, 2018-01-14, 2018-01-15, 2018-01-16, 2018-01-17, 2018-01-18, 2018-01-19
  //| , 2018-01-20, 2018-01-21, 2018-01-22, 2018-01-23, 2018-01-24, 2018-01-25, 20
  //| 18-01-26, 2018-01-27, 2018-01-28, 2018-01-29, 2018-01-30, 2018-01-31)
}
```

It's as simple as this.

Takeaway:
- You can use  "Pimp My Library" pattern to add new methods to the existing classes.
- nscala-time is an excellent library for working with dates in Scala. It's is built on the top of Java's Joda-Time.
- Adding methods to the existing classes is also described in "Scala Cookbook" (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026914.do).
