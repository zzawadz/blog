<p>I enjoyed work with Facebook’s fastText (<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText" class="uri">https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText</a>) library and its R’s wrapper fastrtext (<a href="https://github.com/pommedeterresautee/fastrtext" class="uri">https://github.com/pommedeterresautee/fastrtext</a>). However, I want to spend some more time with StarSpace library (also Facebook’s library for NLP). Unfortunately, there’s no R package for StarSpace!</p>
<p>It’s quite surprising because I there are thousands of packages. Nevertheless, this one is missing. In the end, I decided to write my wrapper - <a href="https://github.com/zzawadz/StarSpaceR" class="uri">https://github.com/zzawadz/StarSpaceR</a>.</p>
<p>I had some problems with compilation because of dozens of compiler flags which must be set before compilation. I think that for the first time I had to use custom configure script to set up everything paths, flags and so on. The good thing is that in the <code>configure</code> script you can just simply run an R script to do all the job.</p>
<p>I also use some code from <code>fastrtext</code>. The author had a brilliant idea to include a custom header with some macros to change fastText behavior, like redirect streams to the R console, rename the <code>main</code> function to pass <code>CMD check</code> and so on. If you are interested, check his code here: <a href="https://github.com/pommedeterresautee/fastrtext/blob/master/src/r_compliance.h" class="uri">https://github.com/pommedeterresautee/fastrtext/blob/master/src/r_compliance.h</a>.</p>
<p>The current version only supports loading model to the memory and extracting words embeddings for a set of words. Check the example below: .</p>
<pre><code># library(devtools)
# install_github(&quot;zzawadz/StarSpaceR&quot;)

# There&#39;s simple, pretrained model included in the package.
modelPath &lt;- system.file(package = &quot;StarSpaceR&quot;, &quot;exdata/model_class&quot;)

model &lt;- ssr_load_model(modelPath) # load model to the memory
model$get_vectors(c(&quot;words&quot;, &quot;topology&quot;)) # get word embeddings

#                 [,1]         [,2]         [,3]        [,4] ...
# words    -0.00479455 -0.002737640 -0.000592433 -0.00318651 ...
# topology  0.00753618  0.000651733 -0.012981600 -0.01609830 ...</code></pre>
<p>If you have any comments or ideas reach me on Twitter (<span class="citation">@zzawadz</span>) or fill an issue on Github (<a href="https://github.com/zzawadz/StarSpaceR/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/zzawadz/StarSpaceR/issues</a>).</p>
<div id="warning" class="section level2">
<h2>Warning!</h2>
<p>Be cautious. There’s a big problem with the package. An attempt to get the word not present in the dictionary may cause the fatal error and a crash of the whole R session. I will be examining this problem in the meantime (I think it’s a great way to learn all the internals!), but you are warned:) Do not use this on the production!</p>
<pre><code># Not run
# model$get_vectors(c(&quot;wor&quot;))</code></pre>
