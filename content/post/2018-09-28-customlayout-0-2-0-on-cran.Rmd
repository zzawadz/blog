The new version of my `customLayout` package is on CRAN. It now supports working with PowerPoint slides using layouts created in R. For more information please [read the vignette here](https://www.customlayout.zstat.pl/articles/layouts-for-officer-power-point-document.html).

It also extends the idea of adjusting the font size for the `flextable`s ([see this post](https://www.zstat.pl/2018/07/07/calculate-the-font-size-for-the-r-s-flextable-package/)) - check the [phl_adjust_table](https://www.customlayout.zstat.pl/reference/phl_adjust_table.html) function.

I also created a simple roadmap which describes my next steps. Please note that this package is still under development. I guided myself with the idea from http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast - I make it work, but now there's time to make it right;)

Any feedback is welcome:)
