<p>In one of my projects, I had to choose which language I would use to write some small module - C, C++ or Lua. I didn’t want to use C, because the module required a lot of string handling. Another option was C++, but some other parts of the system were written in Lua, so I thought it would be much easier to integrate everything without switching languages, and I had heard some good things about Lua, so in the end, I decided to give it a shot. And this was a right decision.</p>
<p>Lua is a minimal language. In fact, there’s only one primary data structure - an associative array. It’s something similar to Python’s dictionary, but you can build nearly everything based on it, e.g., check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)</a> to see how to implement namespaces or objects using Lua’s arrays.</p>
<p>I found only one confusing thing in that language. When you want to iterate over an array using <code>for</code> loop, you need to use an iterator. So far so good. <code>ipairs</code> works only if the keys are numeric starting from 1, and are continuous (there’re no spaces between them). See the example below:</p>
<pre class="lua"><code>arr = {}
for i=1,5 do 
   arr[i] = i*i
end
for _, val in ipairs(arr) do print(val) end
-- 1
-- 4
-- 9
-- 16
-- 25

print(&quot;Arr size&quot;, #arr)
-- Arr size 5

arr[7] = 49
arr[&#39;error&#39;] = 1000
print(&quot;Arr size&quot;, #arr)
-- Arr size 5  &lt;--- note that the array size is the same, despite we just added two elements 

print(arr[&#39;error&#39;]) -- &#39;error&#39; key exists
-- 1000

for _, val in ipairs(arr) do print(val) end
-- 1
-- 4
-- 9
-- 16
-- 25   &lt;-- the last element is still 25, arr[7], and arr[&#39;error&#39;] are omited

arr[6] = 36 -- fill the space between 5 and 7
print(&quot;Arr size&quot;, #arr)
-- Arr size 7   &lt;-- the size is now 7 because the numeric indexes are now continuous

for _, val in ipairs(arr) do print(val) end
-- 1
-- 4
-- 9
-- 16
-- 25
-- 36
-- 49   &lt;-- arr[7] is present!

-- print with keys
for i,val in ipairs(arr) do print(i, val) end
-- 1    1
-- 2    4
-- 3    9
-- 4    16
-- 5    25
-- 6    36
-- 7    49</code></pre>
<p>If you need to iterate over all elements in the table you need to use <code>pairs</code> iterator. However, the order of elements is not guaranteed, which makes sense because the array is not a vector but something more like a map. See the example:</p>
<pre class="lua"><code>-- create an array with string keys
arrString = {}
for i=1,5 do 
    arrString[&quot;tmp&quot; .. i] = i*i
end

for i,val in ipairs(arrString) do print(i, val) end -- nothing happens

for i,val in pairs(arrString) do print(i, val) end
-- tmp1 1
-- tmp3 9
-- tmp4 16  &lt;---
-- tmp2 4   &lt;---
-- tmp5 25
-- note that the result is not in the order</code></pre>

<h3>Execution speed</h3>
<p>My last concern was a performance because this module had to be quite fast. I only hoped that Lua would be fast enough, otherwise I would be forced to rewrite everything in C++. I still don’t really understand why, but the final code, even without any hand optimizations, is blazing fast, even before using JIT (there’s luaJIT - <a href="http://luajit.org/" class="uri">http://luajit.org/</a>) it was fast enough.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I’m glad that I tried Lua, because it’s tiny, but pleasant and compelling language, and I can highly recommend it to others.</p>
